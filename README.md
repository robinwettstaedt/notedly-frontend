# notedly's (name in progress) backend api

This is the backend to a note taking Progressive Web App (notedly) which I started in order to get to know Node.js, express.js, MongoDB and Next.js with Typescript better.

The idea came from existing apps, such as [notion](https://notion.so/).

## Technologies used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the frontend Typescript Framework
- [React Context-API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for State Management
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling and theming
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for reliable animations in React
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provides the icons used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the Javascript Runtime
- [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the REST API routes on the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the Database
